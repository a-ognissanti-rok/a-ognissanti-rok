Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
 
Iâ€™m currently working at [Asem S.r.l](https://www.asemautomation.com/), a company that is part of the [Rockwell Automation](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/) group. My main focus is on projects related to industrial automation, and in particular, the development and use of [FT Optix](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/products/software/factorytalk/optix.html) software.
 
You can find examples, information, and resources on FT Optix software in the repositories of the [FactoryTalk-Optix](https://github.com/FactoryTalk-Optix) GitHub profile.
 
Iâ€™m passionate about developing efficient solutions for industrial communication and edge computing, helping to bridge the gap between field-level data acquisition and high-level data analysis.
 
Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
